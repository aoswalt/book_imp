# Book Imp

Your **Book Imp** is your personal servant bound to carry out tasks at your command.

## Design

Book Imp is a pluggable application to handle commands from different sources and to interact with various services and systems.

By itself, the core Imp system does not do anything. Communication sources, command providers, and admin tools can be added by plugins.

<!--
## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `imp` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:imp, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/imp](https://hexdocs.pm/imp).
